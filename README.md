# Geekfit

  Introduction:

Our project’s name is GeekFit. It is basically the backEnd part of an application aimed for stay-at-homes “geeks”. It offers the subscribers a virtual world where they can progress gradually and earn score by doing physical activities in the real world.

  How to play:

Progress in the different challenges is made by walking, running or biking in the real world. Obstacles can also be overcome by solving enigmas.

  Tools used for the project:

This app is coded in Java, it also uses different technologies like:

  -	Maven
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
  -	JPA
The JPA specification lets you define which objects should be persisted, and how those objects should be persisted in your Java applications.
  -	MySQL
MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) with a client-server model.
  -	Payara
Payara Server is an open-source application server derived from GlassFish Server Open Source Edition.
  -	Jersey
Jersey is Sun's production quality reference implementation for JSR 311: JAX-RS: The Java API for RESTful Web Services. Jersey implements support for the annotations defined in JSR-311, making it easy for developers to build RESTful web services with Java and the Java JVM.

We invite you to install those pre-requisites if you have not already.
To launch our app, you will have to launch the server, then deploy the app on it. You can have a trace of the different requests by using PostMan.
All the different paths can be found in the Doc folder that includes an index.html page with all the paths and their definitions.
